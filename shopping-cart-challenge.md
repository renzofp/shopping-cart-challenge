# Shopping Cart Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to develop a functioning shopping cart. It should demonstrate your ability with several languages in the typical Web development stack. Build the application in such a way that you would feel comfortable putting it in production and comfortable maintaining.

To be clear, this shopping cart is like any other; it should provide a summary of items in the cart, as well as their quantities, subtotal, grand total, including GST and QST. It is a step before actually checking out, when payment and address must be registered. 

There is no need to build a product catalog and mechanism for adding items to a cart. Assume there are products in a cart already. Assume user is from Quebec. Assume free shipping.

### Functionality

- The cart's content is stored in a database.
- Enable the user to adjust the quantities of the items in the cart.
- State is maintained, per session.

### Minimum Technology Stack

- PHP or Python
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

> ⚠️ Use any tools, frameworks, dependencies, or methodologies you choose. Be sure to separate them from the source code you actually write.
>
> **Additional instructions may be provided to tweak these requirements.** For example, a specific language or framework may be required or restricted, depending on the focus of the challenge.

### Provide the following

- Source code
  - Hosted on GitHub

- Installation instructions
  - Example: utilitizing dependency management configuration via Composer or PiP.
- Tools used for development
- Online demo
