-   Manual seed url enabled when visiting `/seed-cart`
-   Ability to update item quantity on the fly, just like on Amazon!
-   Ability to remove items from the cart
-   Auto calculation of price (quantities, subtotal, GST, QST, and grand total)
-   Nice alert messages for events
-   Guest checkout
